## Project: Perception Pick & Place

---

# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Extract features and train an SVM model on new objects (see `pick_list_*.yaml` in `/pr2_robot/config/` for the list of models you'll be trying to identify). 
2. Write a ROS node and subscribe to `/pr2/world/points` topic. This topic contains noisy point cloud data that you must work with.
3. Use filtering and RANSAC plane fitting to isolate the objects of interest from the rest of the scene.
4. Apply Euclidean clustering to create separate clusters for individual items.
5. Perform object recognition on these objects and assign them labels (markers in RViz).
6. Calculate the centroid (average in x, y and z) of the set of points belonging to that each object.
7. Create ROS messages containing the details of each object (name, pick_pose, etc.) and write these messages out to `.yaml` files, one for each of the 3 scenarios (`test1-3.world` in `/pr2_robot/worlds/`).  [See the example `output.yaml` for details on what the output should look like.](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/pr2_robot/config/output.yaml)  
8. Submit a link to your GitHub repo for the project or the Python code for your perception pipeline and your output `.yaml` files (3 `.yaml` files, one for each test world).  You must have correctly identified 100% of objects from `pick_list_1.yaml` for `test1.world`, 80% of items from `pick_list_2.yaml` for `test2.world` and 75% of items from `pick_list_3.yaml` in `test3.world`.
9. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## Writeup / README

### Exercise 1, 2 and 3 pipeline implemented

The perception pipeline is implemented as described in the [walkthrough exercises](https://github.com/bkecskemeti/RoboND-Perception-Exercises):

*RGB-D image ==> Statistical outlier filter ==> Downsampling ==> Passthrough filter ==> RANSAC plane segmentation ==> Euclidean clustering ==> Object recognition*

#### 1. Statistical outlier filter

![Point cloud](output/rviz_pointcloud.png?s=50)

#### 2. Downsampling

#### 3. Passthrough filter 

#### 4. RANSAC plane segmentation 

#### 5. Euclidean clustering 

#### 6. Object recognition


### Pick and Place Setup

#### 1. For all three tabletop setups (`test*.world`), perform object recognition, then read in respective pick list (`pick_list_*.yaml`). Next construct the messages that would comprise a valid `PickPlace` request output them to `.yaml` format.
